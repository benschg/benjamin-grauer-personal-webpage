He brings not only deep expertise but also humility, curiosity, and a genuine eagerness to learn from others, no matter their title. Benjamin is also one of the most approachable and positive professionals I've worked with. He fosters a truly inclusive and supportive environment where everyone feels valued. His people-first mindset, combined with his technical strengths and can-do attitude, make him a standout leader and a fantastic colleague. Any team would be lucky to have him.",

      "Ben has been my direct manager for over 2 years at Verity. I admire and am confident that Ben's strongest skill is people management. Ben excelled at taking care of myself, and when talking to the people around me, I hear the same over and over: Ben is a manager that people love, trust, and admire. Ben has always been present for me. When I needed to talk I knew he was there. With Ben I could talk about anything that was important to me, he was there to discuss organizational-related challenges and external professional challenges, and he has been of great support in some more challenging moments of my personal life. I always knew if I needed some help, and someone who would listen, and provide support Ben was there for me. Ben has been a key figure in helping me initiate, execute, and finalize the initiative here at Verity. Ben supported me in many initiatives and helped to open the right doors to ensure such initiatives' success. When I struggled to find bandwidth, and Ben recognized the importance of other ideas I would have, he would take over these initiatives and independently drive them to ensure their success. Another amazing skill of Ben is that he's not the person who has his ideas and opinions and imposes them on others, he rather listens to the concerns and ideas of his teams and identifies which are the important ones to execute. Ben has always shared feedback with me in a very constructive, directive, and empathic way. He praised me and criticized me when it was necessary. Ben has never waited to provide feedback, he has provided it timely and when I most needed it. At the same time, Ben has always been open to me providing feedback, he would listen, process, and when necessary iterate over what we discussed together. Overall, I would recommend any organization to work with Ben, he's undoubtedly among the best people person you can find on the market. Teams are going to thrive guided by his leadership.",

From the very beginning it was Benjamin's clear vision and valuable leadership capabilities that led to a successful cooperation. To me - the technical leader on the project - it was the most inspiring to experience how consistent and well-thought that product vision was. On top of that, the presentation and lecture skills of Benjamin were superb. I also did enjoy our technical discussions, doubts and bright ideas while spending long hours on refining sessions - I believe it was inspiring for the rest of the team. Benjamin is a model role for a technical product owner. He has been also a good friend and mentor.",

      'I have been working with Benjamin for 1,5 year. He played a role of a Head of Data Services at VirtaMed and we (Cybercom) have been selected as a nearshore parter to support the Swiss medtech in launching the Connect product. From the very beginning, Benjamin was interested in building a close partnership with Cybercom. He paid the team regular visits in order to spend the time together, review what has been built and adjust the delivery plan. He was a communication bridge between both companies and put a lot of effort to present us how the business of medical simulations works. He knows the software development very well and could challenge us on every occasion in order to make sure we understand what we are building and focus on stuff that really mattered. His strengths including hard work, dedication, creativity and orientation to details to mention just a few helped to launch the project within just a couple of months from the project kick off. In my view, Benjamin played an instrumental role in turning the project into success and move VirtaMed closer to digitalization. He was a Partner that I could always count on and turn for help to whenever I needed. I can call him a friend and I am looking forward to his next trip to Lodz to show him the city.',

Listening and reflecting are strengths of his, and I really appreciated them. The cooperation was always characterized by mutual respect and a real interest in the inputs and feedback.

His vision for the product and ability to transform business requirements from multiple stakeholders into a coherent product backlog was superb, His transparency in sharing the relevant business information was much appreciated. From the perspective of the supplier, he was a demanding customer, but knew exactly what he want's to accomplish, and he shared the vision with the team, making sure everyone is on the same page. At the same time Benjamin is an engineering Guru, so be prepared for challenging technical discussions and defending your approach, He will listen, and he will take your side if you are right. He takes an extra mile in providing valuable feedback and he is very caring about people in the team. When he gains confidence in team abilities, he steers the development, not letting the details to overburden himself. I will recommend working with/for Benjamin to anyone who wants to excel in software engineering, or making digital products.",
