    "description": "Ever since I discovered programming, I felt the urge to play, craft, create, to shape solutions and to make new things possible, to have an impact on the world with a group of people that I love to share my enthusiasm with.\n\nI grew with empathy, building connections and honoring talent and accepting the weakness both in myself and the people around me. During my career, I've trained hundreds of medical residents and decision makers, built diverse teams for dev-ops, testers, framework, web-technology, and UI/UX engineers, and grown organizations from startup to well-oiled machine."
