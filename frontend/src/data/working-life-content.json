    "description": "From training hundreds of surgeons on bleeding-edge medical simulators to architecting cloud solutions that revolutionized warehouse automation, I've spent 15+ years turning \"what if\" into \"what's next.\" My approach is simple: Build teams where empathy meets excellence. Where diverse talents converge to create something bigger than the sum of its parts. I've grown organizations from startup to well-oiled machine, always believing that the best solutions come from people who are empowered to challenge, create, and care.\n\nWhether it's 3D graphics, cloud architecture, or team dynamics, I bring the same curiosity and passion that hooked me when I first discovered programming. Because at the end of the day, it's not just about the code. It's about the impact we make together."
